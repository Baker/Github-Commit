#### About 

This is an easy to use, allows you to display last time you committed on your repository. 

#### Requirements 

You will need a few different things to make this repository work correctly, all of which will be included but just incase I will include a way to manually down or get them. 



#### Feedback 

If you have any suggestions or recommendations on what I could do to improve this, please go ahead and open an issue, [here](https://github.com/Baker/Last-Commit-Display-Github/issues). I check Github daily and always looking for ways to improve my repository.
